        Warning: as there are only two buffers, and the returned tensors reuse the buffer, you cannot hold more than 2

        Arguments:

                are supported. `-1` indices (not selecting any expert) are supported.
            num_max_dispatch_tokens_per_rank: the maximum number of tokens to dispatch, all the ranks must hold the same value.

                monitoring.

                which should have shape `[num_ranks, num_ranks]` and be typed as `torch.int64`.
                This is useful for detecting and pre-cisely localizing slow anomalies.
            use_fp8: whether to enable FP8 casting, with this, the received data will be a tuple of FP8 tensor and scaling factors.
            round_scale: whether round the scaling factors into power of 2.
            use_ue8m0: whether use UE8M0 as scaling factor format (available only with `round_scale=True`).
            async_finish: the current stream will not wait for the communication kernels to be finished if set.
            return_recv_hook: return a receiving hook if set. If set, the kernel will just do the RDMA request issues,
                but **without actually receiving the data**. You must call the received hook to make sure the data's arrival.
                If you do not set this flag, the kernel will ensure the data's arrival.

            recv_x: a tensor or tuple with received tokens for each expert.

                `[num_local_experts, num_max_dispatch_tokens_per_rank * num_ranks, hidden // 128]` with `torch.float`,
                if `use_ue8m0=False`. With `use_ue8m0=True`, the second one is packed and shaped as
                `[num_local_experts, num_max_dispatch_tokens_per_rank * num_ranks, hidden // 512]` with type `torch.int`.
                Notice that, the last-two-dimension of the scaling tensors are in column-major for TMA compatibility.
                With `use_fp8=False`, the result would be a tensor shaped as

        A low-latency implementation for combining tokens (reduce **with weights**) with NIXL device API.
        This kernel requires all the ranks (no matter intranode or internode) should be visible via RDMA
        Warning: as there are only two buffers, and the returned tensors reuse the buffer, you cannot hold more than 2
            kernels' result tensors at a single moment.

        Arguments:
            x: `[num_local_experts, num_max_dispatch_tokens_per_rank * num_ranks, hidden]` with `torch.bfloat16`,
                the local calculated tokens to be sent to this original rank and reduced.
            topk_idx: `[num_combined_tokens, num_topk]` with `nixl_ep.topk_idx_t`, the expert indices selected by the dispatched
                tokens. `-1` indices (not selecting any expert) are supported. Note that, `num_combined_tokens` equals
                to the number of dispatched tokens.
            topk_weights: `[num_combined_tokens, num_topk]` with `torch.float`, the expert weights selected by the dispatched
                tokens. The received tokens will be reduced with the weights in this tensor.
            handle: the communication handle given by the `dispatch` function.
            use_logfmt: whether to use an internal "LogFMT with dynamic per-64-channel cast" format (10 bits).
            zero_copy: whether the tensor is already copied into the RDMA buffer, should be cooperative
                with `get_next_combine_buffer`.
            async_finish: the current stream will not wait for the communication kernels to be finished if set.
            return_recv_hook: return a receiving hook if set. If set, the kernel will just do the RDMA request issues,
                but **without actually receiving the data**. You must call the received hook to make sure the data's arrival.
                If you do not set this flag, the kernel will ensure the data's arrival.
            out: the in-place output tensor, if set, the kernel will write the result to this tensor and return it directly.
            combine_wait_recv_cost_stats: a cumulative time spent waiting to receive each token tensor for statistics,
                which should have shape `[num_ranks, num_ranks]` and be typed as `torch.int64`.
                This is useful for detecting and pre-cisely localizing slow anomalies.

        Returns:
            combined_x: the reduced token tensor, with shape `[num_combined_tokens, hidden]` and type `torch.bfloat16`.
            event: the event after executing the kernel (valid only if `async_finish` is set).
            hook: the receiving hook function (valid only if `return_recv_hook` is set).
